dotenv.config();


Issues i had faced
for mongo db instead of localhost type 0.0.0.0

to add a details in db
    const newUser = new userModel(req.body)
    newUser.save();

why use hashing - it a one way process - only from plain text to cypher text and not other way 

bcrypt - library to hash passwords
first you need to generate salt and then generate hash using salt 
note each time salt and hash generated different salt and hash is generated 

everytime you generate hash for same text => hash generated is different

syntax of mongo db

token - to perform authentication and autherisation 
token can be of different types - one popular one is JWT (json web token)
jwt.io is the offical website npm install jsonwebtoken
a token consists of differnt part like - header, payload, 
1) header contains metadata like type JWT, algo used for encryption
2) payload - actual data ie user info - name, admin, issued time and session expiry time
3) Sinature 

to create jwt key i have written a variable jwt-secret-key with a random value

jwt.sign( paylod, scret key)
secret key is for encoding (not encypted): if decoding is easy by just visiting jwt.io website then why use it - 
while using special character you may face error - to avoid this issue we ecoding it 
note : iat issued at time will be automatically added
