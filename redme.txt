I have installed modules 
npm install express mongoose dotenv nodemon

to use .env
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
dotenv.config();


Issues i had faced
for mongo db instead of localhost type 0.0.0.0

to add a details in db
    const newUser = new userModel(req.body)
    newUser.save();

why use hashing - it a one way process - only from plain text to cypher text and not other way 

bcrypt - library to hash passwords
first you need to generate salt and then generate hash using salt 
note each time salt and hash generated different salt and hash is generated 

everytime you generate hash for same text => hash generated is different
